        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Saim, and I’m from Muzaffarpur, Bihar. Born on 26 October 2006, I have always had a passion for learning and growing in the field of technology. 
           I have completed my education up to the 12th grade, focusing in the arts stream. Despite not having a strong technical background from the start, I have grown interested in coding.

    <!-- Programming Journey -->
    <section>
        <h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
        <p>Since starting my journey in programming, I’ve explored a few languages. However, I’m still building my skills, especially in HTML and CSS. HTML is like the foundation 
           of a webpage, helping me structure and organize content, while CSS adds style to make it visually appealing. I’m also learning JavaScript, which brings interactivity to websites.
           Even though I’m comfortable with HTML, I find CSS and JavaScript a bit challenging, and I’m working to improve my understanding and skills in these areas. Coding gives me a sense of accomplishment, and I aim to build a strong foundation to grow as a programmer.</p>

        <h3>Programming Languages I am Learning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML:</strong> It is the foundation of every webpage. HTML helps in creating the structure of a page, and I find it relatively simple to use.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS:</strong> CSS is essential for adding style and beauty to a page, like colors, fonts, and layout. Currently, I find CSS a bit challenging but interesting.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript adds interactivity to a website, making it more dynamic. I’m still in the early stages of understanding JavaScript.</li>
            <li><strong>Java:</strong> Java is a powerful, object-oriented language, mainly used in larger applications. I haven't delved deeply into Java, but I’m planning to learn it as I grow.</li>
        </ul>
